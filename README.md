# Laravel Frontend Rights
A package for Laravel 5.1+ where you can restrict certain resources (eg. routes) to only be accessable by a user with the correct rights (roles/policies etc) accessable via an api (eg. for ajax-calls).
Useful for single page applications or frontend route access validation.

## Installation

Install from composer:
```
composer require tecbeast/laravel-frontend-rights
```

Add the service provider to the providers array in config/app.php:
```
'providers' => [

    ...

    TecBeast\FrontendRights\FrontendRightsServiceProvider::class,

],
```
> :warning: If you have a catchall route you will want to place the service provider before the RouteServiceProvider of your application. Otherwise the route will not be accessable.

Publish the config to your application:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="TecBeast\FrontendRights\FrontendRightsServiceProvider"
```

## Configuration

You can configure the config-file in config/frontend-rights.php.

### restricted_access

An associative array of resources (eg. routes) with associated rights (roles/policies) for users that are allowed to access that resource.
The keys are the names of the resources and the values are arrays of allowed policies.
```
'restricted_access' => [
    'resource' => ['authorization1', 'authorization2'],
],
```

You can also specify what model the policy belongs to. The value of 'acl' is the name of the function in the policy and the value of 'model' is the class of the model:
```
'restricted_access' => [
    'show-user' => [['acl' => 'showModel', 'model' => App\User::class]],
],
```

### route

The route that the application will use to access the controller.
```
'route' => '/api/v2/resource/access',
```

### middleware

An array of middleware or middleware groups that the above mentioned route will use (can be left empty if no middleware are wanted).
```
'middleware' => [
    'api'
],
```

### default_model

The model where the policies can be found, if no model is specified.
```
'default_model' => App\User:class
```

### default_property

Default property when accessing a model in DB (can be overriden by request parameter)
```
'default_property' => 'id'
```

## Usage

Create a policy for the class to be used (default is User class):
(https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authorization#creating-policies)

In your policy the name of the functions should be the same names that you assign to resources in restricted_access:
```
'restricted_access' => [
    'restricted-route' => ['admin'],
],
```
Would have the following function in UserPolicy (or the corresponding policy for your User class):
```
public function admin(User $user)
{
    return $user->isAdmin;
}
```

To check if a user have the rights to a resource you send a post request to the route specified in config/frontend-rights.php:
```
https://website.com/api/v2/resource/access
```
With a resource parameter with the name of the resource you want to check:
```
resource = 'restricted-route'
```

### Using bundled resources

You can also send multiple resources in a bundle by using resources (instead of resource) as an array like:
```
resources = [{ resource: 'restricted-route'}, { resource: 'other-route'}]
```

### The response
The response will be an array with all the resources that were checked:
```
[{ data: true, status: 200}, { data: false, status: 200}, { data: { exception: 'SomeException', message: '....', trace: ..., line: 10}, status: 500 }]
```

If access is granted, data will be true (if the user is admin in example).
If access is denied, data will be false (user is not admin in example).
If an exception is thrown, data will be an object with exception, message, trace etc.

Then in your frontend you can parse the value and determine what to do.

Only resources listed in restricted_access will be restricted (all other resources return "true"), like a blacklist with steps (only 1 needs to return true for access).

### Using other model-classes
To use a function from antoher model-policy you can specify it in an array instead:
```
'restricted_access' => [
    'email.create' => [['acl' => 'create', 'model' => App\Email::class]],
],
```
This would use the 'create'-function in EmailPolicy like:
```
public function create(User $user)
{
    return $user->isAdmin;
}
```

### Policy methods with models

To use a policy where a model needs to be retrieved from the database, e.g. updating an email:
```
'restricted_access' => [
    'email.update' => [['acl' => 'update', 'model' => App\Email:class]],
],
```
To use the instance of a model instead of the class, the post parameter also expects a value and a property (optional: property defaults to id):
```
resource = 'email.update'
property = 'id'
value = 1
```
Now the function 'update' in EmailPolicy will be called with the found email from the DB.

#### Exceptions
If no models are found 'Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ModelNotFoundException' will be thrown.
If more than one model is found 'TecBeast\FrontendRights\Exceptions\TooManyModelsException' will be thrown.

### SPA example
An example for SPA would be when you navigate to a new page or want to display only certain things on the page.
You can then send an AJAX-call with the route as resource and when you get a negative response you can choose to redirect, display an error or hide the things that the user are not allowed to see.
